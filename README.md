# WinRST
Having problems installing Windows on Intel 12th gen processors? With our ISO images with built-in IRST driver, you can fix these problems!

# How to install?
To install WinRST, you just need to burn the image to a USB flash drive, or via Ventoy (https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html). Anyone!

# Source code?
Unfortunately, the project does not have source code, because Windows is a closed OS.

# It's free?
Yes, the images are free. But keep in mind that Windows activation is paid.
